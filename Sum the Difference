Problem Description
  Given an integer array, A of size N.
  You have to find all possible non-empty subsequences of the array of numbers and then, for each subsequence, find the difference between the largest and smallest numbers in that subsequence. Then add up all the differences to get the number.
  As the number may be large, output the number modulo 1e9 + 7 (1000000007).
  NOTE: Subsequence can be non-contiguous.

Problem Constraints
  1 <= N <= 10000  1<= A[i] <=1000

Input Format
  First argument is an integer array A.
  
Output Format
  Return an integer denoting the output.

Example Input
A = [9, 3, 5, 2] ans = 53

approach - first calculate sum of maxValues of subsequence - here 9 is max for (2^3) -1 subsequence 5 is max for (2^2)-1 subsequences.
  llly 2 is min for (2^3) -1 subsequence 3 is min for (2^2)-1 subsequences.
  
 Solution: 
 long power(long a, long n, long mod){
    if (n == 0) return 1;
    long hp = power(a, n/2, mod);
    if (n&1){
        return (((hp*hp)%mod)*a)%mod;
    }
    else{
        return (hp*hp)%mod;
    }
}

int Solution::solve(vector<int> &A) {
    sort(A.begin(), A.end());
    int n = A.size();
    long maxDiff = 0, minDiff = 0;
    int mod = 1e9 +7;

    for(int i = 0; i<n-1; i++){
        long val = power(2, n-i-1, mod)-1;
        minDiff += (long)A[i] * val;
    }

    for(int i = n-1; i>0; i--){
        long val = power(2, i, mod)-1;
        maxDiff += (long)A[i] * val;
    }

    return ((maxDiff - minDiff)%mod + mod)%mod;;
}
