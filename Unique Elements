Problem Description
  You are given an array A of N elements. You have to make all elements unique. To do so, in one step you can increase any number by one.
  Find the minimum number of steps.

Problem Constraints
  1 <= N <= 105
  1 <= A[i] <= 109

Input Format
  The only argument given is an Array A, having N integers.
Output Format
  Return the minimum number of steps required to make all elements unique.

Example Input
  A = [1, 1, 3]. ans = 1, we can increase second element by 1 [1, 2, 3]
  A = [2, 4, 5]. ans = 0, All elements are distinct.
  
Solution :

int Solution::solve(vector<int> &A) {
    int count = 0;
    sort(A.begin(), A.end());
    int n = A.size();

    for(int i = 1; i<n; i++){
        if (A[i] <= A[i-1]){
            int diff = A[i-1] - A[i];
            A[i] += diff+1;
            count += diff+1;
        }
    }
    return count;
}

approach after sorting if equal or greater than next element add difference to ith value.
